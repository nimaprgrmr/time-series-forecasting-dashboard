Hello to you, In this proejct i tried to do alot of feature engeneering that convert my dataframe to a format which be suitable for time series predictions.
i use a lot of differente models and at the end found xgboost is the best accurate model for time series predicting problems. 
then i tried to set differente settings for my model until reach best performance of xgboost regression predictor.
after that i think it will be good if the results shown in a plot that everyone could compare better the predictions and the actual data together.
for this task used `Dash` library which is very powerfull and rich library for creating dashboards and also in this dashboard used plotly library for show line plots.
Hope it will be useful for you.
